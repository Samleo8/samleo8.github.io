                    <p>
                        I just can’t sleep, please understand! <br>
                        No really; inside there's a marching band <br>
                        Round and round my head it goes <br>
                        (There's also a circus with a thousand shows) <br>
                        I can't sleep; I can only think -- <br>
                        Thoughts flying down a skating rink
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A bombshell goes off in my head <br>
                        Tanks moving amongst the dead <br>
                        A wave crashes on the shore <br>
                        Bringing up some childhood yore
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You would think they are but dreams <br>
                        Vivid imagination, they merely seem... <br>
                        But no! They are precious thoughts, <br>
                        And sleep would put them to a naught
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And so I stay up, awake in my bed <br>
                        Rolling like the thoughts in my head <br>
                        Taking each one in, I sigh <br>
                        Longing to say goodnight, goodbye <br>
                        But the thoughts they linger on <br>
                        The thoughts again, they have won..
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alas, my body can't take the toll <br>
                        Towards the darkness is its goal <br>
                        The thoughts fade, the fire fizzles <br>
                        The storm but reduced to a drizzle <br>
                        No more thoughts nor jumping sheep <br>
                        Only falling into deeper sleep...

                        Oh humans, they change all the time. <br>
                        And it’s the “Buuks” that make them go... <br>
                        From ugly to lovely. Then ugly back.

                        Humans. They change all the time. <br>
                        Through the eye of the turtle see their world, <br>

                    <p>
                        Sometimes i write poems when high <br>
                        But to that, time to say goodbye? <br>
                        No never mind, the poetry is back, <br>
                        To be yet another pain in the neck.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rhyming! Timing! Chiming! <br>
                        That's all it brings. <br>
                        The poetry, stuck, in your head. <br>
                        As if someone, there, laid: <br>
                        A spark, a glimmer, a seed -- <br>
                        And so, upon your soul it feeds <br>
                        Sucks your memories, eats your pains <br>
                        Till one day, a life it gains...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It grows, takes root <br>
                        It grows, bears fruit <br>
                        And one day, blossoming into hope <br>
                        A new perspective! Hope! <br>
                        Hope. but will it last? <br>
                        Will it die, just as fast? <br>
                        But as it dies, it falls <br>
                        And to another, yet, it calls: <br>
                        “Do you hear me, O weary soul <br>
                        Here I come to make thee whole!”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then it goes down, down low <br>
                        It’s ugly head, never shows <br>
                        Till one day when I am high <br>
                        It surfaces, and says, again, “Hi!”
